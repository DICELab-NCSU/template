# template

This package works with RStudio to set up a template folder structure for a new project. The 
package functions are not directly called by users, but instead work as an add-on to RStudio.

## Installation

You can install the development version of template like so:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("DICELab-NCSU/template")
```

RStudio will recognize the template automatically. When creating an RStudio project in a new 
directory, scroll down the list of creation options to 'DICE Lab Template'.
